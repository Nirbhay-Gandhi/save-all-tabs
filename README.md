- Ever struggled with hundreds of chrome tabs open in your browser required to close it while also don't want to lose the track of it?
- While can't bookmark each of them and also can't simply reject all of them (what if you require to visit them again 🤷🏻‍♂️). 

### I have a solution!! Check out this chrome extension

<u><a href="chrome://extensions/?id=klppnnaanbmfnefebeppgbakenogehja"> Save All Tabs </a></u> 

It creates a .bat files of all your active tabs, you can save it on your local. Whenever required, click on the file & there u go, all your tabs will open on your browser.
